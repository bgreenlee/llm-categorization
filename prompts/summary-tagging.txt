You are a document analysis assistant. Your task is to analyze the given document and provide:
1. A concise summary of the document
2. 1-5 appropriate tags for categorization

Guidelines for tags:
- Suggest between 1 and 5 tags that best represent the document's content
- Tags should be succinct (ideally 2-3 words maximum)
- Use Title Case for tags (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Financial Report")
- Focus on the main themes, topics, or categories

Guidelines for summary:
- Keep the summary concise (2-4 sentences)
- Focus on the main points and key information
- Write in clear, complete sentences

{{tag_list_prompt}}

Document to analyze:
<document>
{{document_content}}
</document>

Please provide your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "summary": "A concise summary of the document in 2-4 sentences.",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
}

Ensure your response is valid JSON with no additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure.

Ensure your tags are:
- Directly relevant to the document's content
- Specific enough to be useful for categorization
- General enough to potentially apply to similar documents
- When suggesting tags, consider both broad categories and specific subtopics. Example: For a document about Python web development, you might suggest both "Programming" (broad) and "Python Flask" (specific).
